# Getting Started

Here, it is assumed you understand the conventions of Vim: if you are new to what normal mode is, and how modal editors work, [read the tutorial](./tutorial.html). If you are familiar with vim, but want to get started without reading the docs, you can [use a preset](./preset_index.html)

There are three parts to the documentation:

1. [Config File Basics](./basics.html)
2. [Keybinding Forms](./key_forms.html)
3. [Extension Commands](./commands.html)
4. [Extension Configuration](./config.html)
