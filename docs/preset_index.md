# Presets

ModalKeys comes with a set of [Vim presets](./presets/vim.html); this can be a useful way to bootstrap your own customized set of modal keybindings.

[PRs](https://github.com/haberdashPI/vscode-modal-keys/pulls) with your own presets are encouraged! It would be great if there were a nice long list of possible keyboard configurations here.
