# Presets

ModalKeys comes with two presents

- [Vim presets](./presets/vim.html)
- [Larkin presets](./presets/larkin.html)

Either can be a useful way to bootstrap your own customized set of modal
keybindings. When you first import these bindings, you will see a visual display
in the panel that documents the effect of each key in the current mode you're
in. To modify these bindings you can export them (using `ModalKeys: Export a preset for keybindings`), change the bindings, and then import your new, customized version of the bindings (using `ModalKeys: Import preset keybindings`).

[PRs](https://github.com/haberdashPI/vscode-modal-keys/pulls) with your own presets are encouraged! It would be awesome if there ModalKeys had a long list of possible keyboard configurations here based on folks personal configurations.
