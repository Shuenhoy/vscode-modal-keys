ModalKeys is an extension for defining modal keybindings in VSCode. The most
prominent [modal
editor](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/57705/modeless-vs-modal-editors)
is [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and ModalKeys includes
[presets](https://haberdashpi.github.io/vscode-modal-keys/preset_index.html) that resemble Vim. While you can emulate existing
modal editors like Vim or
[Kakoune](https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/why-kakoune.html), the real advantage
of ModalKeys is that you create custom modal keybindings.

As a little taste of what's possible, here are the basic movement commands in my configuration file:

```typescript
    "::using::cursorMove::": {
        h: { to: 'left', select: "__mode !== 'normal'", value: '__count' },
        j: { to: 'down', by: 'wrappedLine', select: "__mode !== 'normal'", value: '__count' },
        k: { to: 'up', by: 'wrappedLine', select: "__mode !== 'normal'" , value: '__count' },
        l: { to: 'right', select: "__mode !== 'normal'", value: '__count' },
        gj: { to: 'down', by: 'line', select: "__mode !== 'normal'", value: '__count' },
        gk: { to: 'up', by: 'line', select: "__mode !== 'normal'", value: '__count' },
    },
```

When these key sequences are pressed in normal mode, the built-in VSCode command `cursorMove` will be called with the given arguments. If you don't know what normal mode is [read the tutorial](https://haberdashpi.github.io/vscode-modal-keys/tutorial.html).

To start creating a custom set of keybindings for ModalKeys, you have a few options:

1. Read the [Tutorial](https://haberdashpi.github.io/vscode-modal-keys/tutorial.html)
2. Start with an example [presets](https://haberdashpi.github.io/vscode-modal-keys/preset_index.html), modifying it to your taste as needed.
3. Read through the [Documentation](https://haberdashpi.github.io/vscode-modal-keys/doc_index.html)

If you don't care to create a custom set of keybindings, and prefer to replicate
vim in VSCode, consider using [VSCodeVim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) or
[vscode-neovim](https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim).

## Acknowledgements

ModalKeys is a fork of [ModalEdit](https://github.com/johtela/vscode-modaledit);
I am in debt to the hard and thoughtful work from that extension along with its
meticulous documentation. There are some important features that differ between
the two extensions.

Features that ModalKeys has, which ModalEdit lacks.

1. Concise keymap format: I've created a terser, simplified keymap format
2. Customized modes: You can define your own key modes, to expand the keymap more easily
3. Search term highlighting: ModalKeys highlights search terms by default (there is an open [PR](https://github.com/johtela/vscode-modaledit/pull/19))
4. Search with regex: The `search` command can optionally use regex expressions
4. Kakoune-like 'repeat-selection': ModalKeys provides a
   `repateLastUsedSelection` to make implementing kakoune noun-verb workflows repeatable (in contrast with vim's verb-noun workflows)

ModalKeys is missing a few features I did not want to maintain from ModalEdit: bookmarks and quick snippets. I find these features to be well covered by several existing extensions in VSCode.

There has also been quite a bit of internal refactoring as part of my plans to
pave the way for fully functional keyboard macros and
